## how do I run the Solution?
```
cd src/WebUI
dotnet build
```

### Note:
The initial build will take a few minutes, as it will also install required client-side packages. Subsequent builds will be much quicker.
Then run ``` dotnet run ``` to start the application. The following message will be displayed:
`
Now listening on: https://localhost:port
The port is usually 5001. Open the web site by navigating to https://localhost:port.
